It paid off for Mourinho in the end, but Spurs fans will not allow that kind of
negativity in every home game.

So he still needs to work on his side's style of play, but of course getting a
result this way still has plenty of positives.

Mourinho has been talking a lot about how his players lack confidence,
which he probably did not expect when he arrived at the club.

Well, getting through games like this one will give the players lots of belief,
and we saw some other important signs too.

Mourinho has sorted out Christian Eriksen's situation, by selling him to Inter,
while Jan Vertonghen, another player whose future is uncertain because he
is out of the contract at the end of the season, was on the bench.

| looked out on the pitch and there was not a Spurs player out there whose
focus I would be concerned about any more. Everyone was playing for the
shirt, and giving everything.
