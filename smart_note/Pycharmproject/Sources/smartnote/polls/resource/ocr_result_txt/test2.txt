I have been involved in games like that before, where my team have ended
up winning despite being outplayed for long periods.

You come off thinking 'yes, we worked hard, dug deep and we really
deserved to get something’ then, after the dust settles and you maybe
watch it back, you realise you got away with one, like Spurs did here.

The reality was they were hugely fortunate not to be at least a couple of
goals down before Oleksandr Zinchenko's red card gave them a way back
into the game, and even then their first goal came out of absolutely nothing.
