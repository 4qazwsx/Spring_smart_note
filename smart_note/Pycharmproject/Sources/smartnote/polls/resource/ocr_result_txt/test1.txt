The statistics behind Tottenham's win on Sunday might suggest it was
another Jose Mourinho masterclass. In reality it was more a story of
Manchester City's missed chances.

Yes, in the early stages Spurs looked quite solid and strong, which is the way
Mourinho likes to set his sides up in these big games, but City did what they
always do and broke them down.

Spurs showed character and hung in there thanks to a couple of big
moments - the biggest one being Hugo Lloris' first-half penalty save, which
is when they might have started believing this could be their day.

But if City were anything like as clinical in front of goal as they usually are,
they would have put the game to bed long before Steven Bergwijn put
Tottenham ahead with their first shot at goal after 63 minutes.
