I honestly think City just have to write this game off.

From their perspective, | had plenty of experiences like it in my career too,
when we did everything we needed to do to win a game. Normally that
means you do, and it is especially rare that this City side don't.

Pep Guardiolaâ€™s teams look to play in a certain way, and they did that. They
executed his gameplan to perfection apart from every time they got in the
box, which is where it matters most.

Some of their misses were inexplicable, and from players as good as Kevin
de Bruyne, Sergio Aguero or Raheem Sterling, who over-hit a simple pass in
front of goal.
