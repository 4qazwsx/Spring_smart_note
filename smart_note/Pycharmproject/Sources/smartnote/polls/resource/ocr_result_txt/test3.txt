Tanganga got told ‘you are going nowhere’

I don't blame Jose for playing the way he did against City, because of the
way results went when he first took charge of Spurs.

He knew he had goals in his team so he went out and just let them play, and
they had some crazy results in the first few weeks when they were winning
by all sorts of scores.

That was never going to last. | could feel it coming where, in his mind, he
went ‘enough is enough’. He could not trust his team to go out and score
goals, especially when Harry Kane got injured, so instead he started setting
them up not to be beaten. That was clearly Tottenham's approach against
City on Sunday.

Look at Japhet Tanganga at left-back, for example. He was basically told
"you are not going anywhere today’, so he had to stay back all game.
