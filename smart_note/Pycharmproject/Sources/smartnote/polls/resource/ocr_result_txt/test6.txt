You could see Guardiola was infuriated by all of that, but at the same time
he will understand that it happens. Essentially his team's effort and
character and the way they performed was good, and they created enough
chances to win the game. They just could not score.

It is Zinchenko's red card that | think will annoy him more, because that is

If City had stayed with 11 men, | don't think they would have been beaten.
They might not have gone on to win it, but I don't see them losing the game.
